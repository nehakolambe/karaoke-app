You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

So love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin
Is a holy grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah

I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinkin' straight
My head's spinnin' around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Yeah)
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

(Ah)

I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinkin' straight
My head's spinnin' around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Yeah, yeah)
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Woah)
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do (Ah)
What are you waiting for?

(Ah)
(Ah, ah)
